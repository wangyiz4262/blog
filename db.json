\n\n```javascript\nfunction asyncJob() {\n    for (var i = 0 ; i < 4;) {\n        console.log(i++);\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            console.log(`${i} second has passed.`);\n        }, 1000);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever the result will be like:\n```\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4 second has passed.\n4 second has passed.\n4 second has passed.\n4 second has passed.\n```\n\nThis is due to the fact that the async part will be pushed to the execution stack, which is yet to be run. And when it starts to run, the incrementer has become 4.\n\nA simple solution might be changing `var i` to be `let i`:\n\n```javascript\nfunction asyncJob() {\n    for (let i = 0 ; i < 4;) {\n        console.log(i++);\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            console.log(`${i} second has passed.`);\n        }, 1000);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe new keyword `let` will work on the block level and somehow make sure the variable in the block is properly assigned with the correct value:\n\n```\n0\n1\n2\n3\n1 second has passed.\n2 second has passed.\n3 second has passed.\n4 second has passed.\n```\n\nBut `setTimeout` still runs at the end.

And key part, which makes sure the incrementer and time passed will print together, is returning a new Promise within each `.then()` method.

It may be so, however, I found with the declaration of classes, I became more clear about several concepts that confused me a lot in the functional world.\n\nFirst, a class in JS is still a function, which also exemplifies the idea that functions are first-class citizen in the JS world.\n\n```javascript\nclass Foo {\n    constructor() {\n        this.foo = function() {\n            console.log('foo');\n        };\n    }\n    bar() {\n        console.log('bar');\n    }\n}\n```\n```bash\n>> console.log(typeof Foo)\n'function'\n```\n\nSecond, we know that an important concept in JS is prototype.

In the new ES6 standard, we can also define prototype methods.

But <code>\\`\\\\$$b\\`</code> seems to have first converted `\\$$` into `$$`, which is the process ID of the current shell, then concatenated 'b' at the end and return.\n\t- Therefore a good guess is that <code>\\` \\`</code> grants higher priority to escaped characters than variables when evaluating.\n\t- It is recommended to use `$()` instead of <code>\\` \\`</code> for command substitution.\n\n- Consider another example of using `eval` and `$()`:\n\n\t```bash\n\t$ eval echo \\$$b\n\t10\n\t$ eval $(echo \\$$b)\n\tcommand not found: 10\n\t$ $(echo \\$$b)\n\tcommand not found: $a\n\t```\n\t- `eval echo \\$$b` evaluated `\\$$b` to `$a`, then evaluated `$a` to its value `10` before echoing it out, finally echoed the result.\n\t- `eval $(echo \\$$b)` did the first three steps the same as above, but it has one more step, which was what `$()` did, to execute the result. Therefore you got a not-found error message.\n\t- `$(echo \\$$b)` did the same as the second example, except the double evaluation part. That is, first evaluate `\\$$b` to `$a`, which is associated with \"echo\"; then echoed it out as a string \"$a\"; lastly, ran it as a command, and received a not-found error said \"command '$a' was not found\".","slug":"About-eval-in-Shell","published":1,"updated":"2017-03-04T05:02:06.000Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj2o23f3n00170xrlyqms6gva"},{"title":"Build personal blog with Hexo Part 2","date":"2015-09-26T18:18:31.000Z","_content":"![](/img/2015/09/blog-dnspod.jpg)\n\n## <p align=\"center\">Part 2: Deploy to GitHub</p>\n### Configure GitHub\n1.

Hmm, seems tougher, but still viable. I need to purchase some VPS space, purchase a domain name, download Wordpress framework from wordpress.org, read a lot of tutorials, and install it. Horray, after days' effort, I am finally on my way! But, I do not feel like writing a single word after all these efforts now...\n\nCan I still have blog totally controlled by myself, without ads, without spending a penny? Yes, here comes [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), an interesting project from a young man in Tainwan.\n\n### Instructions\nIf you follow this tutorial, it should not take you more than a hour to finish the whole process.\n\n#### Basic idea\nThe basic idea of using Hexo for building free blogs is to take advantages of several web-based Git repository hosting service, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, GitCafe, etc. They are not only providing source control services, but also providing a service of hosting webpages as a server.\n\nYou will need to creat a new repository, then push your codes to a specific page branch, and done! For example, if you are using GitHub, you only need to push your front-end codes to the branch \"gh-pages\" of your new repository. The branch name for GitCafe is \"gitcafe-pages\". Technically, you can create unlimited sites with this technique.\n\nThe language for writing Hexo blogs is Markdown. A very intuitive language for text writing. The syntax is quite simple which almost without any burden of studying. A more detailed explanation can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).\n\nThere are also a lot of good tutorials online. [This one](http://www.jianshu.com/p/q81RER), for example, shows the most frequently used syntax you may come across.\n\n#### Install neccessary parts\nThere are two software needs to be install ahead, which are Node.JS and Git:\n1. Download and install Node.JS at official website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n2. Download and install Git at official website [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\nYou may find detailed installation instruction on the website above.\n\n#### Install Hexo\nIf you are using Windows, then you will have Git Bash installed when you were installing Git just now. Open it.\nIf you are using Mac or Linux, you can directly open the Terminal app, and enter the following:\n```bash\n$ npm install -g hexo\n```\n\n> <b>Heads up</b>\n> If you see some error like \"-bash: npm: command not found\", then the problem is the directory containing <code>node.exe</code> was not properly added into the environment variables of your operating system. You may refer to tutorial [here](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) are how to set the path and environment variables in Windows. For Mac uses, [this post](http://osxdaily.com/2015/07/28/set-enviornment-variables-mac-os-x/) should have explained very clearly. And I believe Linux users should well know how to set system environment variables.\n\n#### Initiate your blog\n\nNow go to any directory you like, say <code>D:\\blog</code>. If you are using Windows, press down Shift key, and right click on empty area, select <code>Open command window here</code> in the pop-up menu. If you are using Mac or Linux, just open Terminal and direct to the directory you specified. Then enter following codes:\n```bash\n$ hexo init\n$ npm install\n$ npm install hexo-deployer-git --save\n```\n\nAnd now, you have a preliminary blog set up. You may run following codes to view the result:\n```bash\n$ hexo g\n$ hexo s\n```\n\nYou will see a line of code says \n```bash\nINFO  Hexo is running at http://0.0.0.0:4000/.
